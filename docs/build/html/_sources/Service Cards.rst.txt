What are Service Cards?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Service Card is the digital representation of a service and is how the citizen accesses the service from CitizenOne. A Service Card will belong to one or more :ref:`Applications <applications>` defined in CitizenOne. A Service Card may have it's own :ref:`Policy <policies>` that will be presented along with any :ref:`Application(s) <applications>` and :ref:`Organization(s) <organizations>` :ref:`Policies <policies>` that have been defined that relate to the Service Card. The Service Card may also have :ref:`Rules <rules>` that need to be passed in order to access the service. Once the citizen successfully connects to the service, a list of tasks will be presented to the citizen that will navigate the user to the appropriate form or screen in an application.
