Linking Forms to Service Cards
*****************************************

You can link a form to a service card causing the form launch as submission to appear as a task on the service card. Form responses you ahve already submitted will appear as separate actions below that.

The form will display when you click the "Launch <Form Name>" action and can be filled out and submitted.

In order to link a form to a service card you need to:

1. Make sure the service card is :ref:`connected to an aplication<application_service_cards>`.
2. Make sure that the service card :ref:`application has a policy<application_policy>`. 
3. :ref:`Create a form<creating_forms>` in the same organization and application that is linked to the service card.
4. Navigate to the Form tab for your service card and select the form from the list.

You cannot link or unlink applications from service cards on this screen. However, if you click the highlighted "click here" text it will take you to the applications screen where you can add or remove service cards to applications.
