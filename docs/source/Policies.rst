What are Policies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Policies are the terms in which the user must agree to in order to use the service. A Policy can also include consenting to sharing mandatory and optional pieces of information about the citizen with the service. A citizen may also choose to revoke consent with a service and sever their access between CitizenOne and the service, including access to the citizen's profile information. A Policy can exist at any level of the hierarchy - :ref:`Tenant <tenants>`, :ref:`Organization <organizations>`, :ref:`Application <applications>` and :ref:`Service Cards <service_cards>`.
