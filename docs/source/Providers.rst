What are Trust Providers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Trust Provider is an authoritative source that can provide verified credential(s) (additional pieces of information) about the citizen. This is used to establish a greater identity certainty and in building a trusted profile. Services with access to sensitive information may require a higher level of certainty in the citizen's identity in order to access the service. These are defined as :ref:`Rules <rules>` in CitizenOne. No information provided to and from the Trust Provider is stored in CitizenOne. Rather, once the citizen has onboarded with the Trust Provider, a tokenized representation of the citizen is stored that allows CitizenOne to perform specific pre-defined requests about the citizen.
