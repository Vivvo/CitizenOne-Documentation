What are Rules?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Rule is a particular requirement a service has that the citizen must pass in order to access the service. A Rule may have more than one :ref:`Trust Provider <providers>` that can be used to pass the Rule if multiple authoritative sources exist that can fulfill the same claim about the citizen. Rules to access a service are checked every time a citizen accesses a service to ensure they are still passed successfully before proceeding to the service.
