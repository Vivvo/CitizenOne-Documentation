What are Tenants?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Tenant is the government organization who licenses and manages an instance of CitizenOne. Admin users of the tenant are typically responsible for digital identity for the government and work with other business areas (:ref:`Organizations <organizations>`) to 
onboard new services to CitizenOne. These users are responsible for creating :ref:`Organizations <organizations>` within CitizenOne and can manage :ref:`Applications <applications>`, :ref:`Policies <policies>`, :ref:`Service Cards <service_cards>`, :ref:`Trust Providers <providers>`, :ref:`Rules <rules>` and :ref:`Email Templates <email_templates>` within CitizenOne. End user support for citizens would also typically be managed at the tenant level for platform-specific inquiries.
