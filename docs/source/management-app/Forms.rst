Forms
#####

Vivvo Trust Platform features a robust No-Code Form Builder that allows forms to be created without the need to write and deploy code. This allows for the creation of data in-take/entry forms that can be exposed as the front-end of a government service to a citizen.  The forms are then used by the citizen to enter data and submit them as requests to government related to specific services they want to consume (a renewal form for a library or a driver's license, for example). Forms can be attached to a Service Card allowing citizens to complete and submit the form.

The list of all available forms can be accessed by clicking **Form Builder** under the **Forms** tab of the sidebar.
