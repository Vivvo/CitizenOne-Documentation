The Management Application on the Vivvo Trust Platform gives the client the ability to make different changes to their instance of the platform, view different reports based on different metrics and modify citizen information such as email, address etc.

The app has a lot of features which may differ from one organization’s instance to another. This user guide is a technical communication document that contains instructions on how to use the different features of the Management App. 

.. note::
   Please note that the screenshots contained in this document may not reflect the same branding and style guide as the instance used by the user but steps to perform the action described in this document should remain the same. Also, the Management App has strong Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) for enabling specific functions for certain users. A government organization may have chosen to disable certain functionality in their instance of the management app, meaning some sections in this document are not applicable to every user.
