Maintenance notices are used to inform the citizens on your instance of the Vivvo Trust Platform of important events such as system maintenance, upgrade etc. The list of all maintenance notices created on that instance can be accessed by clicking **Maintenance Notices** under the **Support** tab of the sidebar.

You can create a new maintenance notice by clicking [**+Create**] at the top of the page, enter the required information (start date & time, end date & time, title and details) and then click [**Create**] at the bottom of the page. A preview of the notice is available at the top of the page â€“ it is updated as you enter the required information so you can see exactly how your notice will look when it is implemented on the Platform.
