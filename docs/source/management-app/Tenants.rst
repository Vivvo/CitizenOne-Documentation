A Tenant is the government organization who licenses and manages an instance of the Vivvo Trust Platform. Admin users of the tenant are typically responsible for digital identity for the government and work with other business areas (:ref:`Organizations <organizations>`) to onboard new services to the platform. These users are responsible for creating :ref:`Organizations <organizations>` within the Vivvo Trust Platform and can manage :ref:`Applications <applications>`, :ref:`Policies <policies>`, :ref:`Service Cards <service-cards>`, :ref:`Trust Providers <trust-providers>`, :ref:`Rules <rules>` and :ref:`Email Templates <email-templates>` within the platform. End user support for citizens would also typically be managed at the tenant level for platform-specific inquiries.
