Data Bundles
#############

Data bundles are an end-to-end encrypted solution for keeping information about a user in sync between different datastores.

A Data Bundle is a block of data with a structure that is defined by the consumers and providers of said data. The bundles are used to keep downstream service providers up to date and aware of changes made to an Identityâ€™s profile without the need for Vivvo Trust Platform to oversee the changes themselves.
