Form Responses
################

Form responses are responses to any of the forms submitted by an end-user or citizen as part of consuming a service on your instance of the Vivvo Trust Platform.  These are the responses to citizen's request made on applications or responses to claims made by the user to a downstream application as to their identity i.e. using their driver's license, for example, to validate their identity. 

Form-based service cards can also be integrated to a downstream application like a CRM â€“ which is a part of an organisation's existing business processes and is therefore capable of communicating a response back to the platform for a form received from it.

These form responses are visually presented when you click on **Form Responses** under the **Forms** tab of the sidebar.
